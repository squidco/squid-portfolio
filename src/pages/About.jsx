        About Me,
      </h1>

        As you might've seen on the landing page, my name is Anthony Pillow. I'm
        more than just a Web Dev. I am a drummer, scholar, motorcycle rider,
        photographer, rockclimber, surfer, longboarder, gamer, friend, brother,
        and son. I've always been drawn to computers and technology but growing
        up I never thought I had what it took to code. Come to find out it just
        takes a lot of patience and some padded walls so you don't hurt your
        head when you slam it after realizing the error you had been searching
        for since last week was a typo.

      <p className="text-base">
        Learning to code has been one of the best decisions of my life. I've
        always loved to solve problems and what is coding if not that?
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="text-base">
        But learning to code has only been a part of my journey. I have so many
        other experiences that make me, well, me. So below you will find some of
        those experiences and you can get to know me just a bit better.
